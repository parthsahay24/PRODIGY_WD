        <p>Welcome to my online resume! My name is Parth Sahay and I am a second year btech student. With 2 years of
            experience in Web Development, I am passionate about coding and enjoy learning new technologies. My main
            focus is on front-end development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have experience with back-end languages
            such as Java and Python.
            I'm also interested in playing musical instruments. And that's why I'm a professional guitarist and work
            as a band leader too. I'm also good in sports like volleyball, cricket and many such games.

            But still I thrive on coding, and I am committed to Full Stack Web Development.

            certifications, publications, and how to get in touch with me.
